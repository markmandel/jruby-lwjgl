# Opengl

Examples of using [LWJGL](http://www.lwjgl.org/) with [JRuby](http://jruby.org/).

As I'm learning LWJGL and OpenGL, I'm uploading examples here and writing blog posts on my [blog](http://www.compoundtheory.com)

This is set up as a gem for convenience, although I can't see why you would want to install it.

## Usage

You may want to install JRuby with RVM, as the .rvmrc sets up the appropriate JRUBY_OPTS environment variables to tell JRuby
to tell the JVM to load up the native extensions that LWJGL needs.
